    <h2>Part 2: Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        In Part 2, you will answer the same three questions from Part 1. However,
        you will now be given additional information about the workers in the form
        of a graph showing how many workers scored within each interval.
        <br><br>
        <u>Example:</u><br>
        <img 
          width="600" 
          style="width: 600px; height: 481px;" 
          src="https://christinasun.net/asset_hosting_service/instructions/deg_wtp/assets/dist_frequency.png" 
          height="481"
          alt="Distribution Graph Example"
        >
        <br>
        In this example, the x-axis represents score ranges, and the y-axis shows
        the number of workers who scored within each range. For instance, about
        26 workers scored between 1 and 3.
      </li>

      <li>
        Please spend at least 90 seconds reviewing the graph in Part 2 before continuing. The "Next" button will become available once the required time has elapsed.
      </li>


      <li>
        Bonus calculations in Part 2 works the same as Part 1. Basically, more accurate answers will increase your chance of earning more bonus.
      </li>
    </ol>
