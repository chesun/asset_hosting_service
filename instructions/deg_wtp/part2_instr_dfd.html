<h2 style="text-align: center;">Part 2: Instructions</h2>

<ol>
	<li>In Part 2, you will answer the same 2&nbsp;questions as in Part 1. However, this time you will receive some information about the workers to help you answer the questions. This is in the form of a graph, which shows you how many workers&nbsp;scored in a given interval.&nbsp;<br>
	<u>Example</u>:<br>
	&nbsp; <img width="600" style="width: 600px; height: 481px;" src="https://christinasun.net/asset_hosting_service/instructions/deg_wtp/assets/dist_frequency.png" height="481"><br>
	In the above example, the graph shows the score distribution of a hypothetical Worker Group. On the x-axis are the possible score intervals, and on the y-axis are the number of workers in this Worker Group whose score fall into each interval. For example, we can see that around 13 workers scored between 1 and 3.</li>
	<li><strong>The information you learn in Part 2 will be helpful for completing your&nbsp;tasks better&nbsp;in Part 3</strong>.</li>
	<li>At the end of the experiment, we will <strong>randomly select 20% of participants</strong> to be paid a bonus based on their choices.</li>
	<li>If you are selected to be paid a bonus, we will randomly select one question from the survey and use your answer to determine your bouns. If you are selected to be paid a bonus, and the selected question is in Part 2:
	<ol>
		<li>If the question is to guess the number of workers with each possible score:<br>
		One of your answers in this question is randomly selected, and you are paid a 8 EC bonus if your answer is within ±2 of the correct answer. Otherwise you are paid 0.</li>
		<li>If the question is to guess the average score/age:<br>
		You are paid a 8 EC bonus if your answer is within ±2 of the correct answer. Otherwise you are paid 0.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
