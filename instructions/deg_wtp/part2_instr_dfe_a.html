<h3>Part 2 Overview</h3>

<ul>
	<li>In Part 2, you will be answering the same questions as in Part 1. However, this time you can learn about this group of workers by <strong>drawing workers</strong> from them.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<h3>Part 2 Details</h3>

<ol>
	<li>In order to help you make more accurate guesses, you can <strong>"draw" some workers from this group</strong>. We will show you a button like the one below, and each&nbsp;time you click the button, it will <strong>randomly draw one worker</strong>&nbsp;<strong>(every worker is equally likely to be drawn)</strong> and show you which interval (1 to 3, 4 to 6, 7 to 9, and 10 to 12) the worker's score is in. This <strong>won't affect your earnings</strong> -- it's just a chance to learn about these workers.<br>
	<u>Example:</u>&nbsp;<br>
	<img width="600" style="width: 600px;" src="https://christinasun.net/asset_hosting_service/instructions/deg_wtp/assets/sample_min.png"><br>
	In the example above, you have clicked to sample a worker and the computer randomly selected a worker nicknamed Min who scored between 1&nbsp;and 3&nbsp;points (shown in red).</li>
	<li>You can draw a worker <strong>every&nbsp;3&nbsp;seconds</strong> and <strong>as many times as you like</strong>. Each time,&nbsp;the computer <strong>draws&nbsp;from the same 100 workers</strong>.</li>
	<li>Bonus calculations in Part 2 works the same as Part 1. Basically, more accurate answers will increase your chance of earning more bonus.</li>
</ol>
