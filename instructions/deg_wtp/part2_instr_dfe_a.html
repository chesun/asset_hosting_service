    <h2>Part 2 Instructions</h2>
    
    <h3>Part 2 Overview</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In Part 2, you will be answering the same questions as in Part 1. However, 
        this time you can learn more about the same group of workers by 
        <strong>drawing workers</strong> from them.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Part 2 Details</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In order to help you make more accurate guesses, you can 
        <strong>"draw" some workers from this group</strong>. We will show you a button 
        (example button below), and each time you click it, it will 
        <strong>randomly draw one worker</strong> 
        (<strong>every worker is equally likely</strong>) and show you which interval 
        the worker’s score is in (1–3, 4–6, 7–9, or 10–12). 
        <strong>This won't affect your earnings</strong>; 
        it’s just a way to learn about these workers.
        
        <!-- Example button in the webpage (non-functional) -->
		<button class="draw-button" onclick="drawWorker()">Draw a Worker</button>

    <!-- A place to display the worker draw results -->
    <div id="result" class="result-area"></div>

        <div class="example-box">
          <u>Example:</u><br>
          <img 
            src="https://christinasun.net/asset_hosting_service/instructions/deg_wtp/assets/sample_min.png" 
            alt="Sample Worker"
          />
          In this example, you clicked to sample a worker and 
          the computer randomly selected a worker nicknamed Min, 
          who scored between 1 and 3 points (shown in red).
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        You can draw a worker <strong>every 3 seconds</strong> 
        and <strong>as many times as you like</strong>. 
        Each time you draw, the computer <strong>selects from the same 100 workers</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bonus calculations in Part 2 work the same way as in Part 1. 
        Essentially, more accurate answers will increase your chance 
        of earning a higher bonus.
