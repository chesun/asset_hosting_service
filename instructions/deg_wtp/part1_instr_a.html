<h2>Survey Overview</h2>

<p>This survey has 3 parts. We will provide detailed instructions in the beginning of each part. As an overview, here's what you will do in each part:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Part 1: make guesses about some worker groups</li>
	<li>Part 2: learn more information about the worker groups, and make the same guesses again as in Part 1</li>
	<li>Part 3: play the role of an employer to hire workers</li>
</ol>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<h2>Bonus</h2>
In this survey, all bonuses will be paid in Experimental Currency units (EC). Any EC you earn will be exchanged to USD at the end of experiment following the conversion rate of 1 EC = 0.5 USD.<br>
<br>
There are a few ways you can earn a bonus:
<ol>
	<li>We will ask you to complete two&nbsp;comprehension check quizzes about the instructions, one for&nbsp;Part 1 and one for Part 3. You will receive 1 EC bonus for each quiz you answer <strong>correctly on the first try</strong>.</li>
	<li>At the end of the experiment, we will randomly select 20% of participants to be paid a bonus based on their choices. If you are selected to be paid a bonus, we will randomly select one question from the survey and use your answer to determine your bonus.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
	<li>You will answer a comprehension quiz for the following instructions. You will receive a 1 EC bonus if you answer the questions&nbsp;<strong>correctly on the first try</strong>.</li>
	<li>We have recruited a group of 100 Asian workers who are U.S. residents. They completed a timed math test with 12 questions on algebra, geometry, and arithmetics in 6 minutes.

You will be making choices about these workers throughout this&nbsp;survey.</li>
	<li>Each worker received a&nbsp;<strong>score</strong> that equals to the number of questions they answered correctly (out of 12).&nbsp;For example, a worker who answered 5 questions correctly would have a score of 5.</li>
	<li>In Part 1, we will ask you 3&nbsp;questions regarding this worker group:
	<ol>
		<li>Guess the number of workers in the group that had each possible score<br>
		<u>Example:</u><br>
		&nbsp;<img width="600" style="width: 600px;" src="https://christinasun.net/asset_hosting_service/instructions/deg_wtp/assets/pmf.png"></li>
		<li>Guess the average score of workers in the group<br>
		<u>Example</u>:<br>
		&nbsp;<img width="600" style="height: 136px; width: 600px;" src="https://christinasun.net/asset_hosting_service/instructions/deg_wtp/assets/avg_score.png" height="136"></li>
        <li>Guess the average age of the workers<br>
            <u>Example:</u><br>
            &nbsp;<img width="600" style="width: 600px;" src="https://christinasun.net/asset_hosting_service/instructions/deg_wtp/assets/avg_age.png"></li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>If you are selected to be paid a bonus, and the selected question is in Part 1:
	<ol>
		<li>If the question is to guess the number of workers with each possible score:<br>
		One of your answers in this question is randomly selected, and you are paid a 8 EC bonus if your answer is within ±2 of the correct answer. Otherwise you are paid 0.</li>
		<li>If the question is to guess the average score/age:<br>
		You are paid a 8 EC bonus if your answer is within ±2 of the correct answer. Otherwise you are paid 0.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
