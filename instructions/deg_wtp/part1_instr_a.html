<h2>Survey Overview</h2>

<p>This survey has 3 parts. We will provide detailed instructions in the beginning of each part. As an overview, here's what you will do in each part:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Part 1: make guesses about some workers</li>
	<li>Part 2: learn more information about the workers, and make the same guesses again as in Part 1</li>
	<li>Part 3: play the role of an employer to hire workers</li>
</ol>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<h2>Bonus</h2>
There are a few ways you can earn a bonus:

<ol>
	<li>We will ask you to complete two&nbsp;comprehension check quizzes about the instructions, one for&nbsp;Part 1 and one for Part 3. You will receive $0.5&nbsp;for each quiz you answer <strong>correctly on the first try</strong>.</li>
	<li>At the end of the experiment, we will randomly select 20% of participants to be paid a bonus based on their choices. If you are selected to be paid a bonus, we will <strong>randomly select one question</strong> from the survey and use your answer to determine your bonus.</li>

	<li>You will answer a comprehension quiz for the following instructions. You have 2 attempts for each question.</li>
	<li>We have recruited a group of ${e://Field/group_size}&nbsp;workers from Prolific who are U.S. residents. They completed a timed math test with 12 questions in 6&nbsp;minutes.

	<li>Each worker received a&nbsp;<strong>score</strong> that equals to the number of questions they answered correctly (out of 12).&nbsp;For example, a worker who answered 5 questions correctly would have a score of 5.</li>
	<li>In Part 1, we will ask you 3&nbsp;questions regarding these workers:
	<ol>
		<li>Guess the number of workers&nbsp;that had each possible score<br>
		<u>Example:</u><br>
