    <h3>Part 2 Overview</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In Part 2, you will be answering the same questions as in Part 1. However, this time you can learn about this group of workers by <strong>drawing 20 of them at random</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    &nbsp;
    
    <h3>Part 2 Details</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li>In order to help you make more accurate guesses, you can <strong>randomly drawn workers</strong> by clicking&nbsp;a button labeled "Draw a Worker". Each click&nbsp;will&nbsp;<strong>randomly select one worker</strong>&nbsp;from the group of workers (<strong>every worker is equally likely</strong>), and show you the&nbsp;score range (1–3, 4–6, 7–9, or 10–12) of that worker. <strong>This does not affect your earnings</strong>; it simply gives you more information about the group.<br>
        <u>Example:</u>&nbsp;<br>
        <img width="600" style="width: 600px;" src="https://christinasun.net/asset_hosting_service/instructions/deg_wtp/assets/sample.png"><br>
        In this example, 2 workers were randomly drawn: one&nbsp;who scored between 4&nbsp;and 6&nbsp;points, and another&nbsp;scored between 7&nbsp;and 9&nbsp;points&nbsp;(highlighted in red).</li>
        <li>You can&nbsp;draw a worker <strong>every&nbsp;3&nbsp;seconds</strong>. Once a worker has been chosen, they cannot be chosen again (i.e., no worker appears more than once). Continue until you have drawn exactly 20&nbsp;workers.</li>
        <li>Bonus calculations in Part 2 is the same as Part 1. More accurate answers increase your chances of earning a higher bonus.</li>
    </ol>
