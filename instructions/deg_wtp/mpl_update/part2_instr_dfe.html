    <h2>Part 2 Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Part 2 Overview</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In Part 2, you will be answering the same questions as in Part 1. However,
        this time you can learn more about the same group of workers by
        <strong>drawing workers at random</strong>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Part 2 Details</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In order to help you make more accurate guesses, you can <strong>randomly draw&nbsp;workers</strong> by clicking&nbsp;a button labeled "Draw a Worker". Each click&nbsp;will&nbsp;<strong>randomly select one worker</strong>&nbsp;from the group of 100 workers (<strong>every worker is equally likely</strong>), and show you the&nbsp;score range (1–3, 4–6, 7–9, or 10–12) of that worker. <strong>This does not affect your earnings</strong>; it simply gives you more information about the group.<br><br>
        <!-- Example button -->
        <button class="draw-button" onclick="drawWorker()">Draw a Worker from a Hypothetical Group</button>
        <!-- A place to display the worker draw results -->
        <div id="result" class="result-area"></div>

        <div class="example-box">
          <u>Example:</u><br>
          <img
            src="https://christinasun.net/asset_hosting_service/instructions/deg_wtp/assets/sample.png"
            alt="Sample Worker"
          >
          In this example, 2 workers were randomly drawn: one&nbsp;who scored between 4&nbsp;and 6&nbsp;points, and another&nbsp;scored between 7&nbsp;and 9&nbsp;points&nbsp;(highlighted in red).
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        You can draw a worker <strong>every 3 seconds</strong>
        and do it  <strong>as many times as you like</strong>.
        Each draw is always from the same 100 workers.
      </li>

      <li>
        Bonus calculations in Part 2 is the same as Part 1.
        More accurate answers increase your chances
        of earning a higher bonus.
