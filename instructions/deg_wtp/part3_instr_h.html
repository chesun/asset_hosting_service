            <li style="text-align: left;">Please pay attention to the following instructions. As a reminder, we will ask you some comprehension check questions about the Part 3 instructions.
            <ul>
                <li style="text-align: left;">If you answer these questions&nbsp;<strong>correctly on the first try&nbsp;</strong>you will receive a 1 EC bonus.</li>
                <li style="text-align: left;">You have 2 attempts for each question.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li style="text-align: left;">In Part 3, you will play the role of an employer who is hiring workers.</li>
            <li style="text-align: left;">You have 12 EC in your "account"&nbsp;to use in this part.</li>
            <li>You will be presented with 4&nbsp;workers who are <strong>randomly drawn&nbsp;</strong>from our group of workers. You will see a nickname,&nbsp;profile avatar, and a short profile for each worker.<br>
            <u>Example Profile:</u><br>
            &nbsp;<img width="400" style="width: 400px; height: 275px;" src="https://christinasun.net/asset_hosting_service/instructions/deg_wtp/assets/profile_example_h.png" height="275"></li>
            <li>For each worker, <strong>your task is to make a wage offer (between 0 and 12 EC)</strong>. The wage offer is accepted or rejected by the following algorithm:
            <ul>
                <li>A random&nbsp;"asking salary" between&nbsp;0 and&nbsp;12&nbsp;is randomly generated by the computer.</li>
                <li>If the asking salary is less than or equal to your wage offer, the offer is accepted. You pay the asking salary to hire the worker, and receive 1 EC&nbsp;for every question the worker answered correctly. i.e. your profit = worker's score - asking salary.</li>
                <li>If the asking salary&nbsp;is greater than your wage offer, the offer is rejected. You receive no profit.</li>
                <li>Your total profit = profit from wage offer + money left in your account</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The following are a few example scenarios of how the algorithm works:
            <ul>
                <li><u>Example 1:</u>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your wage offer is 6 and the worker's score&nbsp;is 9.</li>
                    <li>The asking salary is 2.</li>
                    <li>Since asking salary &lt; wage offer, your offer is <strong>accepted</strong>.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>You earn a profit&nbsp;of worker score - asking salary = 9 - 2&nbsp;= 7</li>
                    <li>Your total profit is (12 - 2) + 7 =17 EC</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li><u>Example 2:</u>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your wage offer is $9&nbsp;and the worker's score is 10.</li>
                    <li>The asking salary is 11.</li>
                    <li>Since asking salary &gt; wage offer, your offer is <strong>rejected</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Your total profit is 0.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li><u>Example 3:</u>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your wage offer is $8&nbsp;and the worker's score is 4.</li>
                    <li>The asking salary is 6.</li>
                    <li>Since asking salary &lt; wage offer, your offer is <strong>accepted</strong>.</li>
                    <li>You earn a profit of worker score - asking salary = 4 - 6 = -2 EC.</li>
                    <li>Your total profit is (12 - 6) + -2 = 4 EC</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The wage offers you make<strong> do not affect the earnings of the workers</strong>.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>At the end of the survey, 20% of participants will be randomly selected to be paid a bonus. If you are selected to be paid a bonus, one of the questions will be randomly selected and your answer is used to determine your bonus.
            <ul>
                <li>If the selected question is a wage offer in Part 3, then your bonus will be your total profit in that question</li>
                <li>Your bonus is converted to USD (1 EC = 0.5 USD) at the end of the experiment and paid to you within one week of completion</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
