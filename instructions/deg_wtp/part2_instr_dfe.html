<h3>Part 2 Overview</h3>

<ul>
	<li>In Part 2, you will be answering the same questions as in Part 1. However, this time you can learn about the Worker Groups by <strong>sampling workers</strong> from them.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<h3>Part 2 Details</h3>

<ol>
	<li>In order to help you make more accurate guesses in this part, you can <strong>"sample" from this group of workers</strong>. We will show you a button like the one below, and each&nbsp;time you click the button, it will <strong>randomly draw one worker</strong>&nbsp;and show you which interval (1 to 3, 4 to 6, 7 to 9, and 10 to 12) the worker's score is in. This <strong>won't affect your earnings</strong> -- it's just a chance to learn about workers in each group.<br>
	<u>Example:</u>&nbsp;<br>
	<img width="600" style="width: 600px; height: 186px;" src="https://christinasun.net/asset_hosting_service/instructions/deg_wtp/assets/sample.png" height="186"><br>
	In the example above, you have clicked to sample a worker and the computer randomly selected a worker who scored between 4 and 6 points (shown in red).</li>
	<li>You can sample workers&nbsp;<strong>as many times as you like</strong>.&nbsp;However, there is a ${e://Field/draw_cooldown_sec}&nbsp;second "cool down" period each time after you sample before you can click the button again. This is to make sure you take the time to&nbsp;understand the information.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Each time you sample, the computer will <strong>put the sampled worker&nbsp;back into the group</strong> before you sample again.</li>
	<li><strong>The information you learn in Part 2 will be helpful for completing your&nbsp;tasks better&nbsp;in Part 3</strong>.</li>
	<li>At the end of the experiment, we will <strong>randomly select 20% of participants</strong> to be paid a bonus based on their choices.</li>
	<li>If you are selected to be paid a bonus, we will randomly select one question from the survey and use your answer to determine your bouns. If you are selected to be paid a bonus, and the selected question is in Part 2:
	<ol>
		<li>If the question is to guess the number of workers with each possible score:<br>
		One of your answers in this question is randomly selected, and you are paid a 8 EC (Experimental Currency) bonus if your answer is within ±2 of the correct answer. Otherwise you are paid 0.</li>
		<li>If the question is to guess the average score/age:<br>
		You are paid a 8 EC&nbsp;bonus if your answer is within ±2 of the correct answer. Otherwise you are paid 0.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
