    <h2>Survey Overview</h2>

    <p>
      This survey is divided into three parts. Each part begins with its own set of 
      detailed instructions. Below is a brief overview of the tasks you will complete:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Part 1:</strong> Make guesses about a group of workers.</li>
      <li><strong>Part 2:</strong> Receive more information about those workers, then 
          make the same guesses again.</li>
      <li><strong>Part 3:</strong> Act as an employer to hire workers.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Bonus</h2>
    <p>You can earn bonus payments in the following ways:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        We will ask you to complete two comprehension-check quizzes on the instructions: 
        one before Part 1 and one before Part 3. You will receive $0.50 for each quiz 
        you answer <strong>correctly on your first try</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        At the end of the experiment, we will randomly select 20% of participants to 
        receive a bonus based on their choices. If you are selected, we will 
        <strong>randomly pick one question</strong> from your survey responses and use your 
        answer to determine your bonus.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Part 1 Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        You will begin Part 1 by answering a comprehension quiz on these instructions. 
        You have two attempts for each question.
      </li>
      <li>
        We recruited 100 U.S.-based Prolific workers who completed a timed math test: 
        12 questions in 6 minutes. To see an example of the types of math questions 
        they answered, click

        Each worker’s <strong>score</strong> is the number of questions they answered 
        correctly (out of 12). For instance, a worker who answered 5 questions correctly 
        would have a score of 5.
      </li>
      <li>
        In Part 1, you will answer three types of questions about these workers:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Estimate how many workers had each possible score (from 0 to 12).<br>
            <u>Example:</u><br>

            >
          </li>
          <li>
            Estimate the <strong>average score</strong> among all 100 workers.<br>
            <u>Example:</u><br>

          </li>
          <li>
            Estimate the <strong>average age</strong> of these workers.<br>
            <u>Example:</u><br>
            <img
              src="https://christinasun.net/asset_hosting_service/instructions/deg_wtp/assets/avg_age.png"

        <strong>Payment for Part 1:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If the selected bonus question is “Guess the number of workers with each possible 
            score”: one of your guesses (for one of the possible scores) will be chosen 
            randomly. If your guess is within ±2 of the correct number, you will earn 
            a $4 bonus; otherwise, you will earn nothing for that question.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the selected bonus question is “Guess the average score” or “Guess the average age”:
            You will earn $4 if your guess is within ±2 of the correct answer; otherwise, 
            you will earn nothing for that question.
