    <h2>Survey Overview</h2>

    <p>
      This survey has 3 parts. We will provide detailed instructions in the 
      beginning of each part. As an overview, here's what you will do in each part:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Part 1: make guesses about some workers</li>
      <li>Part 2: learn more information about the workers, and make the same guesses again as in Part 1</li>
      <li>Part 3: play the role of an employer to hire workers</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Bonus</h2>
    <p>There are a few ways you can earn a bonus:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        We will ask you to complete two&nbsp;comprehension check quizzes about the instructions, 
        one for&nbsp;Part 1 and one for Part 3. You will receive $0.5&nbsp;for each quiz you answer 
        <strong>correctly on the first try</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        At the end of the experiment, we will randomly select 20% of participants to be paid a bonus 
        based on their choices. If you are selected to be paid a bonus, we will 
        <strong>randomly select one question</strong> from the survey and use your answer to 
        determine your bonus.

        Each worker received a&nbsp;<strong>score</strong> that equals the number of questions 
        they answered correctly (out of 12).&nbsp;For example, a worker who answered 
        5 questions correctly would have a score of 5.
      </li>

          <li>
            Guess the number of workers&nbsp;that had each possible score<br>
