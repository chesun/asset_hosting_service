    <h2>Part 2 Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Part 2 Overview</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In Part 2, you will be answering the same questions as in Part 1. However,
        this time you can learn more about the same group of workers by
        <strong>drawing random workers</strong>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Part 2 Details</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In order to help you make more accurate guesses, you can
        <strong>"draw" workers</strong> by clicking a button labeled "Draw a Worker"
        (see below). Each time you click it, one worker will be <strong>randomly selected</strong> from the group of 100
        (<strong>every worker is equally likely</strong>). You will see which score range (1–3, 4–6, 7–9, or 10–12) that worker falls into.
        <strong>This does not affect your earnings</strong>; it simply gives you more information about the group.
        <br><br>
        <!-- Example button -->
        <button class="draw-button" onclick="drawWorker()">Draw a Worker</button>
        <!-- A place to display the worker draw results -->
        <div id="result" class="result-area"></div>

        <div class="example-box">
          <u>Example:</u><br>
          <img
            src="https://christinasun.net/asset_hosting_service/instructions/deg_wtp/assets/sample_mateo.png"
            alt="Sample Worker"
          >
          In this example, a worker nicknamed Mateo was randomly drawn,
          whose score was between 7 and 9 points (highlighted in red).
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        You can draw a worker <strong>every 3 seconds</strong>
        and do it  <strong>as many times as you like</strong>.
        Each draw is always from the same 100 workers.
      </li>

      <li>
        Bonus calculations in Part 2 is the same as Part 1.
        More accurate answers increase your chances
        of earning a higher bonus.
