        We recruited 100 hispanic Prolific workers who completed a timed math test: 
        12 questions in 6 minutes. To see an example of the types of math questions 
        they answered, click

        You will make choices about these workers throughout this survey.
      </li>
     
      <li>
        Each worker’s <strong>score</strong> is the number of questions they answered 
        correctly (out of 12). For instance, a worker who answered 5 questions correctly 
        would have a score of 5. No one had 0 points.
      </li>
      <li>
        In Part 1, you will answer three types of questions about these workers:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Estimate how many workers had each possible score.<br>

        <ul>
          <li>
            If the selected bonus question is “Guess the number of workers with each possible 
            score”: one of your guesses (for one of the possible scores) will be chosen 
            randomly. If your guess is within ±2 of the correct number, you will earn 
            a $4 bonus; otherwise, you will earn nothing for that question.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the selected bonus question is “Guess the average score” or “Guess the average age”:
            You will earn $4 if your guess is within ±2 of the correct answer; otherwise, 
            you will earn nothing for that question.
