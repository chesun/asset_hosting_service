            <ol>
                <li style="text-align: left;">Please pay attention to the following instructions. As a reminder, we will ask you some comprehension check questions about the Part 3 instructions. If you answer these questions <strong>correctly on the first try </strong>you will receive a $0.5 bonus.</li>
                <li style="text-align: left;">In Part 3, you will play the role of an employer who is hiring workers from our Worker Groups.</li>
                <li style="text-align: left;">As a reminder, the Worker Groups are:
                <ol>
                    <li>Group Y, consisting of 18-45 years old workers</li>
                    <li>Group Z, consisting of 46+ years old workers</li>
                    <li>Group A, consisting of asian workers</li>
                    <li>Group B, consisting of black workers</li>
                    <li>Group W, consisting of white workers</li>
                    <li>Group H, consisting of hispanic workers</li>
                </ol>
                </li>
                <li>You will be repeatedly presented with pairs of workers who are <strong>randomly drawn </strong>from the Worker Groups. You will see a nickname and profile avatar for each worker.</li>
                <li>For each pair of workers, you will complete 3 tasks:
                    <ol>
                        <li>You will&nbsp;<strong>hire</strong> <strong>one</strong> of them.<br>
                        <u>Example</u>:<br>
                        &nbsp;<img width="600" style="width: 600px; height: 239px;" src="https://ucdavis.co1.qualtrics.com/CP/Graphic.php?IM=IM_kfgxupXT5jlPJys" height="239"></li>
                        <li>You will also&nbsp;<strong>evaluate</strong> <strong>both workers&nbsp;</strong>by guessing what you think their scores are.<br>
                        <u>Example</u>:<br>
                        &nbsp;<img width="600" style="width: 600px; height: 434px;" src="https://ucdavis.co1.qualtrics.com/CP/Graphic.php?IM=IM_QSsadfyxFQyoBLE" height="434"></li>
                        <li>Finally, you will guess the age of both workers.<br>
                        &nbsp;<img width="600" style="width: 600px; height: 364px;" src="https://ucdavis.co1.qualtrics.com/CP/Graphic.php?IM=IM_W4OCY3Dx377vXxr" height="364"></li>
                    </ol>
                    </li>
                <li>The hiring and evaluation decisions you make<strong> do not affect the earnings of the workers</strong>. However, they <strong>will</strong> <strong>affect your bonus earnings</strong>.</li>
                <li>At the end of the survey, 20% of participants will be randomly selected to be paid a bonus. If you are selected to be paid a bonus, one of the questions will be randomly selected and your answer is used to determine your bonus.
                <ol>
                    <li>If the selected question is a hiring choice:<br>
                    If you hired the worker with the <strong>higher score, </strong>you will earn a bonus of $10. Otherwise you will earn $0.<br>
                    If both workers have the same score, you will be paid by a computer coin toss.</li>
                    <li>If the selected question is a worker evaluation:<br>
                    One of your evaluations will be selected to determine your bonus.<br>
                    If the score you reported is within Â±2 points of the true score, you will earn a $10 bonus. Otherwise you will earn $0.</li>
                </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
