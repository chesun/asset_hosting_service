    <h3>Part 2 Overview</h3>
    In Part 2, you will be answering the same kind of questions you did in Part 1 - you will answer 3 questions regarding each Worker Group. However, this time you can learn about the workers in the groups by <strong>sampling workers</strong> from them.

    <h3>Part 2 Details</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li>In order to help you make more accurate guesses in this part, you can <strong>"sample" from each of the worker groups</strong>. For each worker group, we will show you a button like the one below. Each time you click the button, it will <strong>randomly draw one worker</strong> from the corresponding Worker Group and show you which interval (1 to 3, 4 to 6, 7 to 9, and 10 to 12) the worker's score is in. This <strong>won't affect your earnings</strong> -- it's just a chance to learn about workers in each group.<br>
        <u>Example:</u>&nbsp;<br>
        <img width="600" style="width: 600px; height: 196px;" src="https://ucdavis.co1.qualtrics.com/CP/Graphic.php?IM=IM_et6BC1lOVpmHxYO" height="196"><br>
        In the example above, you have clicked to draw a worker from Group W and the computer randomly drew a worker who scored between 4 and 6 points (shown in red).</li>
        <li>You can sample from each Worker Group <strong>as many times as you like</strong>. However, there is a 2 second "cool down" period each time after you sample before you can click the button again. This is to make sure you take the time to understand the information.</li>
        <li>Each time you sample, the computer will <strong>put the sampled worker back into the Worker Group</strong> before you sample again.</li>
        <li><strong>The information you learn in Part 2 will be helpful for completing your tasks better in Part 3</strong>.</li>
        <li>At the end of the experiment, we will <strong>randomly select 20% of participants</strong> to be paid a bonus based on their choices.</li>
        <li>If you are selected to be paid a bonus, we will randomly select one question from the survey and use your answer to determine your bouns. If you are selected to be paid a bonus, and the selected question is in Part 2:
        <ol>
            <li>If the question is to guess the number of workers with each possible score:<br>
            One of your answers in this question is randomly selected, and you are paid a $10 bonus if your answer is within ±2 of the correct answer. Otherwise you are paid $0.</li>
            <li>If the question is to guess the average score/age:<br>
            You are paid a $10 bonus if your answer is within ±2 of the correct answer. Otherwise you are paid $0.</li>
        </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
