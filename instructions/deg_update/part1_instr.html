    <ol>
        <li>You will answer a comprehension quiz for the following instructions. You will receive a $0.5 bonus if you answer the questions <strong>correctly on the first try</strong>.</li>
        <li>We have recruited a pool of potential workers who are U.S. residents. They completed a math test with ${e://Field/n_math} questions on algebra, geometry, and arithmetics. The workers had ${e://Field/minutes_math} minutes to spend on the math test. Click <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZsxqqrsE_cnDo6ROjTWEuZ0i_gC1cpHSsL8dqYnawYQ/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> to see example math questions. You will be making choices and answering questions about these workers throughout this&nbsp;survey.</li>
        <li>Each worker received a <strong>score</strong> that equals to the number of questions they answered correctly (out of ${e://Field/totalpoints}). For example, a worker who answered 5 questions correctly would have a score of 5.</li>
        <li>Out of this pool, we created 6 worker groups as follows:
        <ol>
            <li>Group Y consisting of 18-45 years old workers</li>
            <li>Group Z consisting of 46+ years old workers</li>
            <li>Group A consisting of asian workers</li>
            <li>Group B consisting of black workers</li>
            <li>Group W consisting of white workers</li>
            <li>Group H consisting of hispanic workers</li>
        </ol>
        </li>
        <li>We will ask you 3 questions regarding each worker group:
        <ol>
            <li>Guess the number of workers in the group that had each possible score<br>
            <u>Example:</u><br>

            <li>Guess the average score of workers in the group<br>
            <u>Example</u>:<br>
            &nbsp;<img width="600" style="width: 600px; height: 116px;" src="https://ucdavis.co1.qualtrics.com/CP/Graphic.php?IM=IM_gALNOFsP4JnXVzD" height="116"></li>
            <li>Guess the average age of workers in the group<br>
            <u>Example</u>:<br>
            &nbsp;<img width="600" style="width: 600px; height: 162px;" src="https://ucdavis.co1.qualtrics.com/CP/Graphic.php?IM=IM_dsX4hPXUWRXYWoG" height="162"></li>
        </ol>
        </li>
        <li>If you are selected to be paid a bonus, and the selected question is in Part 1:
        <ol>
            <li>If the question is to guess the number of workers with each possible score:<br>
            One of your answers in this question is randomly selected, and you are paid a $10 bonus if your answer is within ±2 of the correct answer. Otherwise you are paid $0.</li>
            <li>If the question is to guess the average score/age:<br>
            You are paid a $10 bonus if your answer is within ±2 of the correct answer. Otherwise you are paid $0.</li>
