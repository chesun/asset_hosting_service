    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Overview:</strong> In this part, you’ll consider hiring decisions for a set of 
      workers. After reading these instructions, you’ll answer a short comprehension quiz 
      (2 attempts per question). Then, you’ll make your hiring choices that can affect 
      your bonus.
    </p>

    <ol>
  
      <!-- 1. Random Worker Profiles -->
      <li>
        <strong>Random Worker Profiles:</strong> You will see
        <strong>8 workers</strong>, each randomly chosen from our group 
        (each worker has an equal chance of being selected).
        <br><br>
        Each worker’s profile includes:
        <ul>
          <li>A nickname</li>
          <li>A profile avatar</li>
          <li>A short description</li>
          <li>Some profiles include the worker's score range, other do not</li>
        </ul>

        <p><u>Example Profile:</u></p>

          alt="Example worker profile"
          style="max-width: 400px; display: block;"
        />
      </li>

      <!-- 2. Your Task -->
      <li>
        <strong>Your Task:</strong> For each worker, you’ll make 12 choices shown in the example below. Each row is a choice between 2 options:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Hire the worker</strong> (option 1, on the left), <strong>and receive
              $1 for every point the worker scored</strong> (out of 12).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Don't hire the worker</strong> (option 2, on the right), <strong>and receive a fixed amount of money</strong> 
            shown for each row.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p><u>Example:</u></p>
        <img
          src="https://christinasun.net/asset_hosting_service/instructions/deg_wtp/assets/mpl_example.png"
          alt="Example multiple price list"
          style="max-width: 600px; display: block;"
        />
        <br>
        You can try out the example task at the bottom of this page.
      </li>

      <!-- 3. Payment for Part 3 -->
      <li>
        <strong>Payment for Part 3:</strong> At the end of the survey, 
        <em>one of your choices</em> (one row) will be randomly selected to calculate 
        your Part 3 bonus.
        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            If you chose to hire the worker (option 1) in that selected row, you earn 
            $1 × the worker’s actual score.
            <br><br>
            <u>Example:</u><br>
            <img
              src="https://christinasun.net/asset_hosting_service/instructions/deg_wtp/assets/switch_5_circle_3.png"
              alt="Hire example"
              style="max-width: 500px; display: block;"
            /> 
            <small>
              Suppose this worker’s actual score was 5. Because you chose “Hire,” you earn $5.
            </small>
          </li>
          <li>
            If you chose the fixed amount (option 2) in that selected row, you get that 
            amount, no matter what the worker’s score is.
            <br><br>
            <u>Example:</u><br>
            <img
              src="https://christinasun.net/asset_hosting_service/instructions/deg_wtp/assets/switch_5_circle_7.png"
              alt="Fixed amount example"
              style="max-width: 400px; display: block;"
            />
            <small>
              Since you chose $7 in the selected row, you earn $7, regardless of the worker’s score.
            </small>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <!-- 4. How to Make Choices (Crossover) -->
      <li>
        <strong>How to make your choices:</strong> Option 1 (on the left) is pre-selected by 
        default. You only need to indicate where you want to “cross” from option 1 to option 2. 
        Below your crossover point, the rows will autofill to option 2. There is no right answer, but make sure your choices reflect your true preferences.
        <br><br>
        <u>Example:</u><br>
        <iframe
          src="https://christinasun.net/asset_hosting_service/instructions/deg_wtp/assets/mpl.gif"
          width="720"
          height="580"
          style="border: none;"
        >
        </iframe>
        <p>You should only have one “crossover” row. Think about why you’d only cross once.</p>
      </li>

      <!-- 5. Note: Impact on Workers vs. Your Bonus -->
      <li>
        <strong>Note:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Your choices <strong>do not</strong> affect the earnings of the workers.</li>
          <li>Your choices <strong>do</strong> affect your bonus for Part 3.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
